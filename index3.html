            <h1>GUTS</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Guts</span> , renowned as the <span> "Black Swordsman"</span> , is a former
                mercenary and branded wanderer who travels the world in
                a constant internal struggle between pursuing his own ends and upholding his attachments to those dear
                to
                him. <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time driven solely by his will to survive, Guts finds purpose in life
                upon joining the Band of the
                Falcon, greatly helping in the faction's storied successes during the Hundred-Year War as captain of the
                band's raiders. He eventually becomes dissatisfied with clinging to Griffith's dream and departs from
                the
                band in pursuit of his own. <br> &nbsp;Following the horrors of the Eclipse prompted by Griffith, Guts
                embarks
                on a two-year war against the God Hand and apostles, becoming increasingly embittered on his one-track
                quest
                for retribution. He in time realizes protecting his regressed lover is more important to him, as well as
                something he cannot do alone, and thus puts aside his quest for revenge while fostering camaraderie with
                new companions. <br> <br>
                Known for his air of austerity, Guts is a gruff, cynical man holding an overall bleak outlook on life.
                This is a consequence of enduring waves of suffering and numerous betrayals since his youth, as nearly
                all highlights of his life have, in time, become lows. In spite of his guarded, brooding exterior, he
                shows a more easygoing, compassionate side around the people he trusts, appearing markedly less
                unsociable and distant, though still retaining his dry candidness. Even as his inner darkness festers
                deep within him and its temptation becomes increasingly harder to resist, he retains his empathy and
                compassion, refusing to discard his humanity. <br><br> In his formative years, Guts is devoid of true
                purpose in life, killing as a child mercenary merely as a means to survive. As a blank slate, he often
                finds himself seeking validation from those he respects most, content so long as "one person [looks his]
                way". His precariousness slowly develops into individuality upon meeting Griffith – someone whom he
                eventually seeks to stand beside as an equal, rather than be looked down on by. The swordsman then
                embarks on a journey of self-discovery, in which he comes to acknowledge his lifelong bond with and

                    Guts was born from the corpse of his lynched mother underneath a hanging tree, where he was left to
                    die
                    alone in a mire of blood and afterbirth. A mercenary group lead by a man named Gambino eventually
                    happened upon the grisly site, presuming the infant to be dead. When the baby began wailing, to the
                    surprise of the mercenaries, an acquaintance of Gambino's, Shisu, immediately took to the child and
                    came
                    to his aid. Gambino allowed the woman to keep Guts for her own personal consolation, despite the
                    circumstances of Guts' birth being considered ominous by his cohorts. Three years later, Guts'
                    surrogate
                    mother contracted the plague, dying as he watched on.

            <div id="text3">
                <p>
                    Under Gambino's tutelage, Guts began honing his swordsmanship at six years of age, and joined the
                    mercenary's band three years later, looking up to his leader as a father figure of sorts. On the
                    night following Guts' first skirmish, a mercenary named Donovan ambushed and raped him in his tent,
                    revealing he bought the boy for a night from Gambino. In a following skirmish, the young mercenary
                    isolated Donovan and eliminated him, refusing to believe the man's claim from the previous night.

                <p>
                    When Gambino lost his leg in battle, his relationship with Guts immediately deteriorated. From
                    verbal to physical abuse, Guts was subjected to various forms of degradation before Gambino
                    eventually made an attempt on his life. Possessed of the notion Guts was the reason for his
                    misfortune, Gambino revealed he did indeed sell Guts out to Donovan, voicing his disgust for the
                    boy's existence. <br><br> Heavily disheartened by this revelation, Guts retaliated and killed his
                    assailant –
                    the closest thing to a father he had ever known. Consequently attacked by Gambino's men and branded
                    a father killer, he fled the encampment with aggressors on his tail, eventually running into a dead
                    end and being shot off a cliff side. From his high fall and a bout with a pack of wolves below,

                he fell unconscious, eventually being
                discovered by and enlisted as a child soldier in another mercenary band that happened upon him.As a
                result of being on the losing side of battle, Guts and his fellow mercenaries were captured and intended
                to work as laborers for their captors. On their way to the castle they were to help construct, Guts met
                a man named Martino, who aided and befriended the injured young mercenary on their trek, even seemingly
                helping him escape.

                    During the siege of a military garrison defended by the Band of the Falcon, Guts joins the fray
                    alongside a mercenary band and narrowly defeats an enemy leader named Bazuso, lowering the enemy's
                    morale and allowing for the fort's capture. In his travels, he is attacked by Band of the Falcon
                    mercenaries seeking to claim his reward and exact revenge for his earlier interference. He easily
                    dispatches most of them until he is met by Griffith, who quickly incapacitates the swordsman and has
                    him brought to the band's encampment.Waking several days later, Guts is given by Griffith the option
                    to join the band, though he promptly
                    refuses, instead opting to challenge Griffith to a duel.

                    claim to him in the advent of defeating him in combat. Harboring a vested interest in Guts, Griffith
                    agrees and the two engage in a sensational battle, with the White Falcon ultimately defeating the
                    swordsman and enlisting him as a member of the Band of the Falcon. (e.t.c....)

                    The Band of the Falcon shortly after sets out to combat the Blue Whale Knights of Tudor. During the
                    engagement, noticing the trouble Casca was having with an enemy commander, Guts intervenes and does
                    battle with the spearman Adon Coborlwitz. Upon candidly defeating his opponent, the raiders captain
                    notices a fainting Casca staggering off a cliff edge and breaks her fall, <br><br> with Guts pulling
                    them ashore and finding them shelter from the chill rain. Believing Casca to be feverish (which he
                    soon realizes is actually her menstruation cycle), he removes her drenched clothes and rewarms her
                    with his body heat while waiting out the rain.When the rain finally ceases, Casca wakes and
                    immediately attacks Guts, flustered by her womanly shortcomings as a soldier.

                Subduing and tiring her out, Guts asks why she became a mercenary to begin with, to which she explains
                the reason for her idolization of and devotion to the White Falcon as his sworn sword, as well as
                the jarring effect Griffith's desire for Guts had on her. Their conversation is interrupted by the
                movements of Tudor troops near their location; realizing enemy forces will soon home in on the area,
                they decide to depart after sunset.(e.t.c....)
